This repository contains the client side of my phase 3 project including the necessary react components and css files.
Run the following steps to properly load the client side front end.

# 1. in terminal run "bundle install"
# 3. in terminal run "npm start"

# the single page application will start in your local browser #

Once loaded you will be logged in as "guest". As a guest you can not save to your portfolio.  The only users that are in the system, based on the seed file, are "Matt" and "Kimmy" (these two usernames are case sensitive). These usernames are case sensitive, and once logged in, can save to their portfolios, enter a purchase price, and view the profit and loss based on price paid.   

In this Single Page Application you can search through cryptocurrencies using the search bar at the top of the page and add whichever coins into your portfolio that you choose.

Once they are added to your portfolio you can input your purchase price to obtain the profit and loss based on the current prices of the corresponding cryptocurrency.

Also, you can remove any cryptocurrencies from your portfolio with the "remove" button.

Thank you for your interest!

Matt
